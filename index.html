                <h2><b>Перелік основних команд:</b></h2>

                <li><b>git config --global user.name blabla / git config --global user.email blabal@bla</b> - With Git,
                    there are many configurations and settings possible. git config is how to assign these settings. Two
                    important settings are user user.name and user.email. These values set what email address and name
                    commits will be from on a local computer. With git config, a --global flag is used to write the
                    settings
                    to all repositories on a computer. Without a --global flag settings will only apply to the current
                    repository that you are currently in.</li>
                <li><b>git init</b> - this command turns a directory into an empty Git repository. This is the first
                    step in
                    creating a repository. After running git init, adding and committing files/directories is possible.
                </li>
                <li><b>git status</b> - this command returns the current state of the repository.
                    git status will return the current working branch. If a file is in the staging area, but not
                    committed,
                    it shows with git status. Or, if there are no changes it'll return nothing to commit, working
                    directory
                    clean.</li>
                <li> <b>git add</b> - adds files in the to the staging area for Git. Before a file is available to
                    commit to
                    a repository, the file needs to be added to the Git index (staging area). There are a few different
                    ways
                    to use git add, by adding entire directories, specific files, or all unstaged files. </li>
                <li><b>git commit</b> - record the changes made to the files to a local repository. For easy reference,
                    each
                    commit has a unique ID.</li>
                <li><b>git log</b> - to show the chronological commit history for a repository. This helps give context
                    and
                    history for a repository. git log is available immediately on a recently cloned repository to see
                    history. </li>
                <li><b>git checkout </b>- to start working in a different branch, use git checkout to switch branches.
                </li>
                <li><b>git branch</b> - to determine what branch the local repository is on, add a new branch, or delete
                    a
                    branch.</li>
                <li><b>git push</b> - sends local commits to the remote repository. git push requires two parameters:
                    the
                    remote repository and the branch that the push is for.</li>
                <li><b>git pull </b>- to get the latest version of a repository run git pull. This pulls the changes
                    from
                    the remote repository to the local computer.</li>
                <li> <b>git merge</b> - integrate branches together. git merge combines the changes from one branch to
                    another branch. For example, merge the changes made in a staging branch into the stable branch.</li>
                <li><b>git clone</b> - to create a local working copy of an existing remote repository, use git clone to
                    copy and download the repository to a computer. Cloning is the equivalent of git init when working
                    with
                    a remote repository. Git will create a directory locally with all files and repository history.</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <i><b>Gitignore file</b> tells Git which files to ignore when committing your project to the GitHub
                    repository. gitignore is located in the root directory of your repo. The .gitignore file itself is a
                    plain text document.</i>

                <h2><b>Advanced:</b></h2>

                <li><b>git revert</b> - you use git revert to record some new commits to reverse the effect of some
                    earlier
                    commits (possibly faulty ones). It is an “undo” command, but technically it is much more than that.
                    Git
                    revert does not delete any commit in this project history.</li>
                <li><b>git reset </b> - git reset is a powerful command that is used to undo local changes to the state
                    of a
                    Git repo. Git reset operates on "The Three Trees of Git". These trees are the Commit History ( HEAD
                    ),
                    the Staging Index, and the Working Directory.</li>
                <li><b>git rebase</b> - rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new
                    base
                    commit. Rebasing is most useful and easily visualized in the context of a feature branching
                    workflow.
                </li>
                <li><b>git cherry-pick</b> - powerful command that enables arbitrary Git commits to be picked by
                    reference
                    and appended to the current working HEAD. Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a
                    branch
                    and applying it to another. git cherry-pick can be useful for undoing changes.</li>
                <li><b>git stash</b> - to save changes made when they're not in a state to commit them to a repository.
                    This
                    will store the work and give a clean working directory. For instance, when working on a new feature
                    that's not complete, but an urgent bug needs attention.</li>
